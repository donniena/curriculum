# Why learn Python?

---

## Content

Python is the language of the present and the future. Here's why:

- **Simplicity**

It's easy to read and understand. It usually requires less code than other languages like Java and C++ to accomplish the same tasks.
 
- **Perfect for Data Science and ML**

It has numerous [libraries](https://enki.com/glossary/general/library) that let us tackle complex problems with a few lines of code. That's why Python developers are amongst the highest paid in data-related fields.

- **Huge Community**

If you get stuck on a problem, you have a massive online community to help you out. You can always find the answers, whether on Google, Stack Overflow, or even Reddit.

## Practice

Python is an easy-to-read language due to its similarity to English.

Can you guess what this code will print if the user's answer is `"Maybe"`?

```python
answer = input("Are you excited to learn Python?")
if answer == "Yes":
  print("That's the spirit! 🎉") 
else:
  print("Don't give up, you're doing great! 🤗")
```

???

- `"Don't give up, you're doing great! 🤗"`
- `"That's the spirit! 🎉"`
